# spacex_launch_stats
This repository contains a python code to analyze and show the statistics related to SpaceX launches

# Main idea
The main idea is to create a python code that scans the data included in the webpage [Wiki - List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches "Just click on it") and then gathers this informations in a xlsx file (graphs and stats still to be decided)
